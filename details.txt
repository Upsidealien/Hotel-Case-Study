EAN Analytics Case Study
===========================================================

This case study contains information on hotel bookings for one market for a set of stay-dates (arrival-departure combination).
In addition you have information about the searches made, including the prices shown. You are also provided with hotel characteristics.

Your job is to analyse the data to understand hotel pricing and consumer hotel preferences.
	
Expected output:	
	A document detailing your findings
	Code or documentation to reproduce any analysis you have performed

Tips:
	If you are not familiar with the travel industry spend a short amount of time on a travel website (e.g. expedia.com)
	Plots will help you understand the datasets
	Focus on, at most, one or two statistical or machine learning techniques (less is more)
	Spend time on the explanation - it's no use using a smart approach if you don't explain it clearly
	
Good Luck!
